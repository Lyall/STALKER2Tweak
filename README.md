### Steam Deck/Linux Additional Instructions
ðŸš©**You do not need to do this if you are using Windows!**

*Either*: Open up the game properties in Steam and add `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dsound=n,b" %command%` to the launch options.
*Or* use Winecfg:
1. Launch Protontricks (Winetricks for GOG-Version).
    - They exist as Flatpak or visit their Github pages, also Launchers like Lutris can come with it.
    - On the GOG version, you can open Winecfg directly, if Stalker uses the main prefix. Proceed to step 5.
2. Pick the Stalker 2 app, if asked.
3. Select default Wineprefix, if asked.
4. Run Winecfg.
5. Select the Libraries Tab.
6. In the Dropdown, select `dsound` and add it. It should default to `dsound (native, builtin)`.
7. Finish with `OK` and then close all windows of Winetricks and you are done.

## Configuration
- See **STALKER2Tweak.ini** to adjust settings.
